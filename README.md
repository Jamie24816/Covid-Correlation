# Covid-Correlation
The models used to write my third year project researching the correlation between Covid-19 cases and equity prices in different sectors.

This repository demonstrates both the code I developed and the reports I wrote while investigating the correlation between Covid-19 cases during the 2020 pandemic and equities in different sectors. With further investigation into whether the Covid cases were causing the correlation between the stock prices and cases, not only being a coincidence, then the models could have been used to predict future stock prices from the Covid-19 cases at the time. The models utilise random sampling, cross-correlation functions, and interpolation to generate the results. A requirement of the project was to manually code as much of the project as possible to show an understanding of the statistics behind the model as well as demonstrate problem solving skills. I have gone onto deepen my knowledge by learning techniques utilisng libraries such as Numpy which would make this code easier to read and more efficient.
