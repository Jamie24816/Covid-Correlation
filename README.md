# Covid-Correlation
The code used to write my third year project looking at the correlation between Covid cases and equity prices in different markets.

This repository demonstrates both the code I used and the reports I wrote to investigate the correlation between Covid-19 cases during the 2020 pandemic and equities in different sectors. With further investigation into whether the Covid cases were causing the correlation between the stock prices and cases, not being just a coincidence, then thee models could have been used to predict future stock prices from the Covid-19 cases at the time. The models utilise random sampling, cross-correlation functions, and interpolation to generate the results.
